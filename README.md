# Week 3 Challenge - Random Password Generator
This application is a tool for generating random strings of characters with a length between 8 and 128 characters. Users can input their preferred set of characters, and the program provides four options, including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.

After selecting the desired character categories, the generator produces a randomized string with at least one character from each selected category. The order of the characters is also randomized, providing increased security and unpredictability.

## Instructions for using the character generator:

1. Specify the desired length of the character string, which should be between 8 and 128 characters.
2. Choose the types of characters you want to include, such as lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters.
3. Click on the "Generate" button to create a new randomized string of characters.
4. The generator will produce a new string of characters each time you click the "Generate" button, ensuring unique and secure results.
